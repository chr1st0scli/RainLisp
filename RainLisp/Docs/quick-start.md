# Quick Start
This guide is designed to help you get started with RainLisp quickly.
It also contains supplementary information to the rest of the documentation.

The author tried to give it some introductory programming course characteristics, so that anyone can benefit from it.
Despite the fact that it focuses on RainLisp and LISP in general, it presents some general educational information
that can be applicable in other contexts too.

It is recommended to download RainLisp console to follow along the examples.

Let's start our endeavor with [numbers](quick-start/numbers.md).

## Data Types
- [Numbers](quick-start/numbers.md)
- [Booleans](quick-start/booleans.md)
- [Strings](quick-start/strings.md)
- [Datetimes](quick-start/datetimes.md)

## Language Basics
- [Variables](quick-start/variables.md)
- [Comment](quick-start/comment.md)
- [Begin code block](quick-start/begin.md)
- [Conditionals](quick-start/conditionals.md)
- [Procedures](quick-start/procedures.md)
- [Loops](quick-start/loops.md)
- [Let code block](quick-start/let.md)
- [Quotes](quick-start/quotes.md)

## Data Structures
- [Pairs](quick-start/pairs.md)
- [Lists](quick-start/lists.md)
- [List operations](quick-start/list-operations.md)
- [User data structures](quick-start/user-data-structures.md)

## Advanced Topics
- [Advanced data structures](quick-start/advanced-data-structures.md)
- [Message passing](quick-start/message-passing.md)
- [Encapsulation](quick-start/encapsulation.md)
- [Data-directed programming](quick-start/data-directed-programming.md)
- [Metaprogramming](quick-start/metaprogramming.md)
- [Even more looping](quick-start/cps.md)

## What's Next?
If you covered all of the above sections, you already have more than what you need,
in order to start using and experimenting with RainLisp yourself.

But if you haven't had enough yet, you may read the old time classic
[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/full-text/book/book.html).
Remember that RainLisp is so much similar to Scheme LISP, which means you can follow along most of the book's examples using RainLisp!

Have fun!
