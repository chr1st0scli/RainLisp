# Quick Start
This guide is designed to help you get started quickly, but it also contains supplementary information to the rest of the documentation.

The author tried to make no assumptions about the reader's level in programming;
the intention is that it will be readable by everyone. Though, some bias might have
been introduced, so it's always useful to have at least some experience.

The quick start guide also presents some general educational information that can be applicable in other contexts too.

It is recommended to download RainLisp console to follow along the examples.

Let's start our endeavor with [numbers](quick-start/numbers.md).

## What's next?
If you covered all of the above sections, you already have more than what you need,
in order to start using and experimenting with RainLisp yourself.

But if you haven't had enough yet, you may read the old time classic
[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/full-text/book/book.html).
Remember that RainLisp is so much similar to Scheme LISP, which means you can follow along the book's examples
using RainLisp!
