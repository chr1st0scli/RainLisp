# Specification

RainLisp is a LISP dialect with many similarities to Scheme, which means it emphasizes on simplicity.

It is a functional programming language, but not purely functional as it supports mutation.

As a LISP dialect, it uses prefix notation.

It adopts an applicative order of evaluation, which means that a function's arguments are evaluated before
the function is applied to them.

It is dynamic.

It is interpreted on the .NET runtime.
