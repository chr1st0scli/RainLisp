# Advanced Data Structures
As mentioned before, someone can create many elaborate data structures with just a simple building block, the simple and humble pair.

Later, when we talk about data-directed programming, we will create a two-dimensional lookup table, where each value
is indexed based on two keys.

For now, you can refer to SICP and see how a [queue](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/full-text/book/book-Z-H-22.html#%_sec_3.3.2)
can be implemented.

You can also have a look at [sets](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/full-text/book/book-Z-H-16.html#%_sec_2.3.3),
which are collections of distinct objects.

Next, let's move on to [streams](streams.md).
